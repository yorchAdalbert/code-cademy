# ES6 Tooling

When using modern js we need two kind of tools...

+ Transpilers:
    It's the combination from two technologies, **Translator** and a **Compiler**.
    This technology converts modern js code into old code (ES5 or less) that browser
    using that kind of code can understand. The most popular one is **Babel**.
+ Bundler:
    It's responsible for combining all our js files into a single file, which is
    called a bundle. most popular one is **Webpack**
